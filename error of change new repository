when I change to new repository, 
some error message 

git remote add origin https://github.com/bioinfo-gao/DMR-comparison.git
git push -u origin master

error message came
To https://github.com/bioinfo-gao/DMR-comparison.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/bioinfo-gao/DMR-comparison.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.


#----solution--#
#---- insert this line
git pull --rebase origin master #  (the --rebase part) your local commits on top of the newly updated origin/master
#----
git push -u origin master
